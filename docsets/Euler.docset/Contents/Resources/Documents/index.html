A computanional framework written in Swift
</div>

<p>Euler is a mathematical framework that is packed up with tons of useful mathematical functions. It is composed of functions in most mathematical fields such as algebra, number theory, statistics, etc&hellip; It was designed to help you turn your computer into a mathematical guru.</p>
<h3 id='inspiration' class='heading'>Inspiration</h3>

<p>The project was largely inspired by:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://theorem.js.org">TheoremJS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sympy.org/">SymPy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mkrd/Swift-BigInt">Swift BigInt</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wolfram.com/language/">Wolfram Language</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id='why-swift' class='heading'>Why Swift</h3>

<p>In retrospect, it isn’t a surprise that Swift is a good fit for the needs of this project. Swift was designed and built by a close-knit team. That team previously built a highly modular and composable compiler infrastructure (LLVM), a compiler and runtime for a highly dynamic Smalltalk-derived language (Objective-C), the compiler for a highly static language with a capable generics system (C++), and a path-sensitive static analysis engine (the Clang static analyzer). Furthermore, the goals for Swift’s design was to build something that was as easy to learn and use as a scripting language, but which had enough power to be used as a system’s programming language.</p>

<p>Swift was the perfect language, because of its performance, modularity, easy to read syntax and concurrrecy APIs. Swift aims to maximize clarity of code, and thus it fights to reduce boilerplate. The top-end goal of Swift is to optimize the time it takes to write and maintain the project, which includes debugging time and other things that go beyond just pounding out the code.</p>
