    /// The standard deviation (SD, also represented by the lower case Greek letter sigma Ïƒ for the population standard deviation or the Latin letter s for the sample standard deviation) is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

    /// In probability theory and statistics, variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean. Informally, it measures how far a set of (random) numbers are spread out from their average value.
